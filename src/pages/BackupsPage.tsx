/**
 * BackupsPage — the dedicated entry point for browsing device backups.
 *
 * Renders <FileBrowser> rooted at /TeleDrive Backups so the user can
 * drill down into the per-device folder tree that the backup runner
 * writes to. The FileBrowser component reads `mode="backups"` and:
 *
 *   - filters out non-backup items (so this view never shows anything
 *     outside the backup namespace),
 *   - shows the read-only banner,
 *   - hides New Folder / Upload actions (backups are immutable),
 *   - renders a "Backups" breadcrumb segment so the user can return
 *     here from nested folders.
 *
 * FREE users see this view empty with the Pro-feature banner pattern
 * from BackupSection — the sidebar entry stays visible so they can
 * discover the feature exists.
